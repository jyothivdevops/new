Track 39.

Now listen and answer questions 7 to 10.

At the moment,

we only have yellow plaques for all the famous people,

but we are aiming to produce different coloured plaques so that people can do specific

walks.

For example,

if they are interested in famous sports personalities,

they can do a tour following the red plaques,

the colour we are aiming to use for these people.

We are looking at introducing grey,

white and green plaques as well.

We are thinking of using grape locks to signify people who have done important work within the

government and white plaques for those who've done good works in the community,

lastly,

are green plugs we think will be very popular.

These will be for painters and sculptors.

Leaving are yellow ones for writers,

actors and other people.

Of Nate.

We do hope you enjoy looking at the plaques around the city.

We have guide books on sale in the gift shop,

where you can find all the plaques.

These are priced at $11.
